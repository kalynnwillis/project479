## Your Requirements

### Original Analysis Plan Items

- [x] **Shrinkage penalty**: Ridge/Lasso/Elastic Net implemented
- [x] **RAPM for NCAA players**: Full implementation
- [x] **Team/opponent controls**: Built into regression
- [x] **Conference structure**: Handled via regularization
- [x] **Win probability model**: 4 models built and compared
- [x] **Accurate WP features**: Home lead + time remaining + interactions
- [x] **Model selection**: Best model chosen by cross-validated AUC

## Ready to Use

### Files You Can Run Immediately

1. **Quick test** (5-10 minutes):
   ```r
   source("quick_test.R")
   ```

2. **Full analysis** (hours):
   ```r
   source("run_analysis.R")
   ```

3. **Individual steps**:
   ```r
   source("R/00_setup.R")
   source("R/01_get_data.R")
   # ... etc
   ```

4. **Generate report**:
   ```bash
   quarto render report.qmd
   ```

### Expected Outputs

After running, you'll have:

- **Tables**: `tables/rapm_rankings.csv`, `tables/top_bottom_players.csv`
- **Figures**: `figs/*.png` (8 different visualizations)
- **Data**: `data/processed/rapm_results.rds`
- **Report**: `report.html` (if rendered)
- **Slides**: `slides.html` (if rendered)

## Quality Checks

- [x] No linting errors
- [x] Consistent code style
- [x] Comprehensive error handling
- [x] Progress messages throughout
- [x] Efficient sparse matrix operations
- [x] Memory-conscious design
- [x] Reproducible results (set.seed())

## Customization Options

Users can easily modify:

- [x] Season (`01_get_data.R`)
- [x] Game limit (`01_get_data.R`)
- [x] Minimum games filter (`04_fit_rapm.R`, `05_eval_plots.R`)
- [x] WP model features (`02_build_wp_model.R`)
- [x] Regularization parameters (`04_fit_rapm.R`)
