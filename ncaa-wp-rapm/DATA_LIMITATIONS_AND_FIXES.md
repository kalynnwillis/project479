# NCAA RAPM Analysis: Data Limitations & Solutions

## üî¥ Current Issues

### 1. **Ridge vs Lasso Plot (Horizontal Line)**
**What you see:** All points at y=0 (Lasso) while x-axis (Ridge) varies  
**Why:** Lasso regression shrunk all player effects to zero  
**Interpretation:** 
- Ridge RAPM: 0.00033 to 0.00084 (small but varying)
- Lasso RAPM: All zeros
- This means Lasso's regularization is too strong for the noisy signal

**Is this normal?** Sort of - it indicates:
- Weak player signal (due to approximate lineup data)
- High multicollinearity
- Lasso is being conservative and saying "can't distinguish individual players reliably"

### 2. **RAPM vs Minutes (Nearly Horizontal)**
**What you see:** RAPM values clustered in narrow range (0.0008-0.0033)  
**Why:** Player-shift assignments are approximate, not actual lineups  
**Current method:**
```
For each shift:
  - Assign ALL players who played >10 min in that game
  - This creates many-to-many joins (wrong!)
  - Can't distinguish who was actually on court
```

**Result:** RAPM can't separate individual player effects well

### 3. **WP Model Performance (May appear clipped)**
**Likely cause:** Y-axis limits or small differences between models  
**Actual values:** AUC ranges 0.868-0.895 (all very good!)

## üîç Root Cause: Missing Lineup Data

Your play-by-play data has **NO lineup information**:

**Available:**
- Game state (score, time, half)
- Team identities
- Box score stats (who played, minutes, pts, reb, ast)

**Missing:**
- Which 5 players were on court for each play
- Substitution events
- Exact lineup combinations

**Impact:** True RAPM requires knowing **exactly** which players were on court. Current analysis approximates this using box scores.

## ‚úÖ Immediate Fixes for Better Visualization

### Fix 1: Adjust regularization strength
Make Lasso less aggressive so it doesn't shrink everything to zero.

### Fix 2: Focus on Ridge RAPM only
Ridge is working better than Lasso for this dataset - use it exclusively.

### Fix 3: Improve plot scales
Zoom in on the actual data ranges instead of using default scales.

### Fix 4: Add uncertainty estimates
Show that RAPM estimates are approximate given data limitations.

## üöÄ Long-term Solutions (Choose Your Path)

### Option A: Accept Limitations (Recommended for class project)
**What to do:**
1. Use Ridge RAPM only (it's working)
2. Interpret as "approximate player impact"
3. Focus on relative rankings, not absolute values
4. Clearly document limitations in report

**Pros:**
- Works with current data
- Still produces meaningful insights
- Honest about methodology

**Narrative for report:**
"Due to lack of play-by-play lineup data, we approximate player effects using box score participation. Results should be interpreted as team-adjusted player quality rather than precise plus-minus values."

### Option B: Get Better Data (Time-intensive)
**Where to find lineup data:**
1. ESPN API (sometimes has lineup data)
2. Sports Reference (manual scraping)
3. Synergy Sports (paid, used by NBA)
4. Manual tracking from video

**Estimate:** 20-40+ hours of additional work

### Option C: Simulate Lineups (Advanced)
**Method:**
1. Use box score minutes to estimate playing time
2. Use starter designation to identify core players
3. Generate probable lineup combinations
4. Weight shifts by lineup probability

**Estimate:** 5-10 hours of coding

## üìä What Your Current Results Actually Mean

**Good news:** Your Ridge RAPM rankings are still meaningful!

**What they represent:**
- Player quality adjusted for teammates and opponents
- Based on game-level participation (not play-level)
- Essentially: "Which players play in game stretches where their team outperforms expectations?"

**Top players (Ridge RAPM):**
1. Jalen Celestine (Cal) - 0.00326
2. Joe Bamisile (Virginia Tech/George Washington) - 0.00250
3. Fardaws Aimaq (Cal) - 0.00185

These ARE real players and these rankings ARE reasonable given the data!

## üõ†Ô∏è Quick Fixes to Apply Now

I can implement these immediately:

1. **Reduce Lasso regularization** - Try lower lambda values
2. **Fix plot scales** - Zoom into actual data ranges  
3. **Add confidence intervals** - Show estimation uncertainty
4. **Create summary tables** - Highlight top/bottom players clearly
5. **Document methodology** - Add clear limitations section

## üéØ Recommendation

**For a class project:** Use current results with better visualization and clear documentation

**For publication:** Would need true lineup data from alternative sources
