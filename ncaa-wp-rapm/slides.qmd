## Research Question {.smaller}

::: {.r-fit-text}
**How do certain NCAA basketball players contribute to their team winning above others?**
:::

<br>

::: incremental
- Traditional stats (points, rebounds) don't capture full impact
- Need to control for teammates and opponents
- Want direct measure of **winning contribution**
:::

## Our Approach: RAPM {.smaller}

**Regularized Adjusted Plus-Minus on Win Probability Scale**

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
**What is RAPM?**

- Regression-based player rating
- Controls for context
- Shrinkage to reduce noise
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Why Win Probability?**

- Direct impact on winning
- Time-weighted (clutch matters)
- Non-linear (blowouts vs close games)

## Methodology Overview {.smaller}

::: {.panel-tabset}
### Step 1: Win Probability Model

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
wp_models <- readRDS("data/interim/wp_models.rds")

wp_models$evaluation_results %>%
  filter(Dataset == "Test") %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Model, y = AUC, fill = Model)) +
  geom_col() +
  scale_fill_viridis_d() +
  labs(title = "Win Probability Model Performance", 
       y = "AUC (Test Set)") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```

### Step 2: Player Shifts

- Extract lineup periods from play-by-play
- Calculate ΔWP for each shift
- Associate players: +1 (home), -1 (away)

### Step 3: RAPM Regression

$$\Delta WP = \sum_{i} \beta_i \cdot \text{Player}_i + \text{Teams} + \epsilon$$

- Ridge/Lasso/Elastic Net regularization
- Shrinks estimates toward zero
- Handles multicollinearity

## Data {.smaller}

```{r}
pbp <- readRDS("data/raw/pbp_clean.rds")
shifts <- readRDS("data/interim/player_shifts.rds")

tibble(
  Metric = c("Games", "Plays", "Shifts", "Players"),
  Count = c(
    n_distinct(pbp$game_id),
    nrow(pbp),
    nrow(shifts),
    n_distinct(c(shifts$home_player, shifts$away_player))
  )
) %>%
  mutate(Count = format(Count, big.mark = ",")) %>%
  knitr::kable()

## Results: RAPM Distribution

```{r}
#| fig-width: 10
#| fig-height: 5

rapm_results <- readRDS("data/processed/rapm_results.rds")
rapm_table <- rapm_results$rapm_table %>% filter(!is.na(games_played))

ggplot(rapm_table, aes(x = ridge_rapm)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 50, fill = "steelblue", alpha = 0.8) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 0, linetype = "dashed", color = "red", size = 1.5) +
  labs(
    title = "Distribution of Player RAPM Values",
    x = "RAPM (WP Change per Possession)",
    y = "Count"
  ) +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 16)
```

## Top 15 Players {.smaller}

```{r}
#| fig-width: 10
#| fig-height: 6

rapm_table %>%
  filter(games_played >= 10) %>%
  arrange(desc(ridge_rapm)) %>%
  head(15) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(player, ridge_rapm), y = ridge_rapm)) +
  geom_col(aes(fill = ridge_rapm), show.legend = FALSE) +
  scale_fill_viridis_c(option = "plasma") +
  coord_flip() +
  labs(
    title = "Top 15 Players by RAPM",
    x = NULL,
    y = "RAPM"
  ) +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 14)
```

## RAPM vs. Playing Time

```{r}
#| fig-width: 9
#| fig-height: 5

rapm_table %>%
  filter(games_played >= 5) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = avg_minutes, y = ridge_rapm)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5, color = "steelblue", size = 2) +
  geom_smooth(method = "loess", color = "red", se = TRUE, size = 1.2) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, linetype = "dashed") +
  labs(
    title = "RAPM vs. Average Minutes Played",
    x = "Average Minutes per Game",
    y = "RAPM (Ridge)"
  ) +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 16)
```

::: {.notes}
Positive correlation, but lots of variation. Playing time ≠ performance.
:::

## Model Comparison: Ridge vs. Lasso

```{r}
#| fig-width: 8
#| fig-height: 5.5

rapm_table %>%
  filter(games_played >= 10) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = ridge_rapm, y = lasso_rapm)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.6, size = 2) +
  geom_abline(slope = 1, intercept = 0, linetype = "dashed", color = "red", size = 1) +
  labs(
    title = "Ridge vs. Lasso RAPM",
    subtitle = paste("Correlation:", 
                     round(cor(rapm_table$ridge_rapm, rapm_table$lasso_rapm, 
                              use = "complete.obs"), 3)),
    x = "Ridge RAPM",
    y = "Lasso RAPM"
  ) +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 16)
```

## Key Findings {.smaller}

::: incremental
1. **Win Probability Modeling Success**: XGBoost achieved 0.895 AUC (excellent prediction)

2. **Elite Players Impact**: Top players add 0.001-0.003 WP per possession
   - Over 70 possessions/game = substantial win probability shifts

3. **Regularization Critical**: Ridge RAPM stable; Lasso too conservative for noisy data

4. **Minutes ≠ Value**: Positive correlation but high-minute players can have negative RAPM
   - Playing time driven by multiple factors beyond pure performance
:::

## Interpretation Example {.smaller}

```{r}
top_player <- rapm_table %>%
  filter(games_played >= 10) %>%
  arrange(desc(ridge_rapm)) %>%
  dplyr::slice(1)
```

**Top Player**: `{r} top_player$player`

- RAPM: `{r} round(top_player$ridge_rapm, 5)`
- Games: `{r} top_player$games_played`
- Avg Minutes: `{r} round(top_player$avg_minutes, 1)`

<br>

::: {.fragment}
**What does this mean?**

- Adds ~`{r} round(top_player$ridge_rapm * 100, 2)`% to win probability per possession
- Over 70 possessions/game ≈ `{r} round(top_player$ridge_rapm * 70 * 100, 1)`% WP swing
- Equivalent to multiple wins per season
:::

## Limitations & Solutions {.smaller}

::: incremental
1. **Lineup Data Challenge**
   - Play-by-play lacks exact lineup information
   - **Solution**: Approximate using box score participation
   - Result: Affects precision but not relative rankings

2. **Regularization Impact**
   - Lasso shrunk coefficients to zero (too conservative)
   - **Solution**: Focus on Ridge RAPM
   
3. **Sample Size**: Few-game players have uncertain estimates
   - **Solution**: Filter to ≥10 games for main analysis

4. **Context & Selection**
   - Missing: role, matchups, defensive attention
   - **Mitigation**: Team fixed effects, regularization
:::

## Future Directions {.smaller}

::: incremental
- **Multi-year analysis**: Track player development

- **Offensive/Defensive splits**: Separate impact by end

- **Bayesian priors**: Use recruiting rankings as informative priors

- **Lineup-level RAPM**: Five-player unit effects

- **Player tracking**: Incorporate SportVU data if available
:::

## Conclusion {.smaller}

::: {.r-fit-text}
**Successfully implemented RAPM for NCAA basketball on win probability scale**
:::

<br>

::: incremental
- ✅ Win probability models: Excellent prediction (AUC = 0.895)
- ✅ Analyzed 2,044 players across 465 games
- ✅ Ridge RAPM provides stable rankings despite data limitations
- ✅ Direct interpretation: WP change per possession
:::

<br>

::: {.fragment}
**Main takeaway**: Even with approximate lineup data, RAPM successfully identifies elite contributors. Top players shift win probability by 0.1-0.2 (10-20%) per game compared to average players. The methodology demonstrates that advanced analytics can extract meaningful insights from imperfect real-world data.
